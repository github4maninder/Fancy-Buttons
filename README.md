# Fancy-Buttons with Create React App

Practices with creating buttons that will change their state when we interact with them.

Each button will have a specific behavior:

The counter button will keep track how many times we click on it. The angry button will change colour to get more red until it reaches a maximum threshold. The light switch button will turn on and off when clicked. The text repeater button will copy the text of the button over and over.
